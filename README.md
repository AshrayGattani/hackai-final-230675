With the help of Fetch.ai's innovative technology, this project creates an intelligent agent dedicated to revolutionizing the shopping experience. Fetch.ai enables the development of intelligent economic agents *capable of executing tasks on behalf of users. By carefully integrating Fetch.ai's documentation and development tools, our project has created an agent that effortlessly handles all the aspects of shopping tasks. This agent not only interprets basic user queries related to **finding products, **comparing prices, and **checking availability* but also excels in executing more complex tasks. These include *making purchases* on behalf of users, *notifying them* of more economical alternatives, employing *conversational AI for generating shopping item images, conducting **sentiment analysis on product reviews, and **preserving user preferences through context storing* for a truly personalized and *dynamic shopping assistant*. This ensures a sophisticated and efficient shopping assistant that can adapt to the diverse requirements of users giving them the ability to independently carry out tasks that align with the user's preferences in the world of online shopping.

``
 git clone https://github.com/AshrayGattani/hackai-final-230675.git
 cd hackai-final-230675
``
## Set Up a Python Virtual Environment:
We recommend creating a clean Python virtual environment using poetry for package management. Initialize a new poetry virtual environment:
``
 poetry init -n && poetry shell
